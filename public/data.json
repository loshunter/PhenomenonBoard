Ron Hubbard (future founder of Scientology), conducted a series of Crowleyan sex-magic rituals known as the \"Babalon Working\":contentReference[oaicite:62]{index=62}. Parsons’ intent was to invoke and manifest an incarnation of the Thelemic goddess Babalon — effectively to summon an elemental female partner or \"Moonchild\" as described in Aleister Crowley’s fiction:contentReference[oaicite:63]{index=63}:contentReference[oaicite:64]{index=64}. The rituals, which drew on Enochian magic and O.T.O. sexual rites, were held at Parsons’ Pasadena home (\"the Parsonage\") and in the Mojave Desert. During the final ritual in late February 1946, Parsons declared the Working successful when a red-haired woman, Marjorie Cameron, unexpectedly arrived at the house; Parsons took her to be the \"elemental\" summoned by the magic:contentReference[oaicite:65]{index=65}. Parsons and Cameron then engaged in ceremonial \"sex magic\" to conceive a magical child intended to be the Thelemic messiah of the New Æon:contentReference[oaicite:66]{index=66}:contentReference[oaicite:67]{index=67}. Throughout the Working, strange phenomena were reported: Parsons wrote that he experienced poltergeist activity, anomalous lights and even that Cameron herself saw a UFO — which Parsons noted in his diary as a possible sign of Babalon’s presence:contentReference[oaicite:68]{index=68}:contentReference[oaicite:69]{index=69}. The Babalon Working has since become legend, with some speculating it \"ripped open a portal\" that coincidentally preceded the modern UFO wave of 1947. Crowley, observing from afar, was skeptical and alarmed, calling Parsons and Hubbard \"louts\" for their dangerous occult experiments:contentReference[oaicite:70]{index=70}:contentReference[oaicite:71]{index=71}.",

That night, the girls challenged the unseen rapper with questions, and the knocks purportedly responded intelligently – for example, tapping out the correct number of years of a person’s age:contentReference[oaicite:86]{index=86}. Neighbors were called in and were astonished as the invisible knockings seemed to answer yes/no and numerical questions, leading to the tale that the spirit was a peddler murdered in the house years earlier and buried in the cellar:contentReference[oaicite:87]{index=87}. The Fox sisters’ story spread rapidly, launching the Spiritualist movement which held that the dead can communicate with the living. By 1849, the girls (with help from their older sister Leah) were demonstrating the \"spirit rapping\" phenomena in public halls in Rochester and New York City to paying audiences:contentReference[oaicite:88]{index=88}. For decades, the Fox sisters were celebrated as famous spirit mediums, and their success led to thousands of others performing séances across America and Europe. In 1888, however, Margaret Fox (by then estranged from her sisters) confessed that the \"rappings\" had been a hoax – she admitted they produced the sound by cracking their toe joints and other trickery:contentReference[oaicite:89]{index=89}:contentReference[oaicite:90]{index=90}. She even demonstrated this live on stage to skeptics and reporters:contentReference[oaicite:91]{index=91}. The following year, Margaret recanted that confession, but by then the damage was done: the sisters fell into poverty and alcoholism, even as Spiritualism as a movement surged on regardless of their exposure:contentReference[oaicite:92]{index=92}:contentReference[oaicite:93]{index=93}.

      "summary": "Between November 1966 and December 1967, dozens of residents of Point Pleasant, West Virginia reported encounters with a bizarre winged creature soon dubbed \"Mothman\":contentReference[oaicite:105]{index=105}. The entity was described as a humanoid, about 6–7 feet tall, with a wingspan over 10 feet and striking red glowing eyes. One of the earliest and most famous sightings occurred on November 15, 1966: two young couples driving near an old TNT factory on the outskirts of town spotted a \"man-sized bird\" with red eyes that chased their car at speeds over 100 mph:contentReference[oaicite:106]{index=106}:contentReference[oaicite:107]{index=107}. Over the following year, many other locals claimed to see the Mothman in the same area—sometimes in flight, other times standing in rural yards or on rooftops. Alongside these reports were other unexplained phenomena: strange lights in the sky, electrical interference, and visits from ominous \"Men in Black\" warning witnesses to stay quiet (as later investigated and popularized by author John Keel). On December 15, 1967, tragedy struck when the Silver Bridge, spanning the Ohio River at Point Pleasant, suddenly collapsed during rush hour, killing 46 people:contentReference[oaicite:108]{index=108}. In the aftermath, local folklore connected the Mothman sightings with the bridge disaster, seeing the creature as a portent or \"banshee\" whose appearance warned of impending calamity:contentReference[oaicite:109]{index=109}. The case was chronicled by Keel in his 1975 book \"The Mothman Prophecies,\" which theorized that Mothman might be an interdimensional being (part of a wave of \"high strangeness\" in the Ohio Valley) rather than a flesh-and-blood cryptid. Skeptics, however, have suggested Mothman was likely a misidentified large bird (such as a sandhill crane or owl) and that the bridge collapse was due solely to a structural failure (not supernatural causes):contentReference[oaicite:110]{index=110}:contentReference[oaicite:111]{index=111}. Nonetheless, the legend of Mothman endures, and Point Pleasant annually celebrates the creature that put their town on the paranormal map.",

      "summary": "In September 1996, after buying the infamous Skinwalker Ranch from the Sherman family, billionaire Robert Bigelow installed a team of scientists and investigators from his National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS) to rigorously monitor the property:contentReference[oaicite:148]{index=148}. Over the next several years (1996–2004), the NIDS team (led by biochemist Colm Kelleher and including retired Army Colonel John Alexander, among others) conducted surveillance with cameras, night-vision gear, and scientific instruments, hoping to capture evidence of the reported phenomena. The ranch did not disappoint, but the phenomena often seemed one step ahead of the observers. NIDS personnel experienced many of the same anomalies: They frequently observed small bright orbs of light floating through the fields, which sometimes displayed seemingly intelligent behavior. On one night in August 1997, two investigators witnessed a bright yellow \"tunnel\" of light appear in a pasture; through their night vision scope they watched a large, dark humanoid creature crawl out of this portal and then vanish into the night:contentReference[oaicite:149]{index=149}:contentReference[oaicite:150]{index=150}. The portal then closed up and the light evaporated:contentReference[oaicite:151]{index=151}:contentReference[oaicite:152]{index=152}. In 1998, after a rash of cattle mutilations, NIDS mounted a 24/7 camera surveillance system. In one incident that July, three cameras overlooking a pasture were mysteriously destroyed at the same moment: all wiring ripped out, but an adjacent camera aimed at the spot recorded no visible intruders – only an odd flash of light around the time of the vandalism:contentReference[oaicite:153]{index=153}:contentReference[oaicite:154]{index=154}. The investigation documented over a hundred anomalies, yet frustratingly yielded few hard proofs. Phenomena tended to occur just outside the range of cameras, or when instrumentation failed. NIDS scientists reported poltergeist-like pranks (equipment would be found mysteriously disassembled), unexplained magnetic spikes, infrared signatures of invisible objects, and dozens of animal mutilations with surgically precise injuries. By 2004, NIDS shifted focus away from the ranch (officially concluding that active phenomena had subsided). The study’s tantalizing yet inconclusive results were later documented in the book \"Hunt for the Skinwalker\" and became part of Defense Intelligence reference material when the U.S. government’s AAWSAP program looked into the ranch years later. The NIDS era at Skinwalker Ranch remains one of the most ambitious studies of a \"paranormal hotspot,\" often cited as evidence that whatever intelligence causes UFO and paranormal events can deliberately evade and manipulate human observation.",

      "summary": "On November 14, 2004, during training exercises about 100 miles southwest of San Diego, the USS Princeton (a Navy cruiser in the USS Nimitz carrier group) detected multiple anomalous aerial vehicles on its SPY-1 radar descending rapidly from ~80,000 feet to near sea level:contentReference[oaicite:200]{index=200}:contentReference[oaicite:201]{index=201}. The Princeton vectored two F/A-18F fighter jets to intercept one of the objects. When the lead jet (piloted by Cmdr. David Fravor with Lt. Cmdr. Alex Dietrich as wing) arrived at the coordinates, they first noticed a patch of roiling white water on the ocean surface – as if something large was just below, and a small whitish oblong object hovering about 50 feet above that disturbance:contentReference[oaicite:202]{index=202}:contentReference[oaicite:203]{index=203}. The object was wingless, about 40 feet long, and shaped like a giant Tic Tac mint – completely smooth, without visible engines, rotors or exhaust plume:contentReference[oaicite:204]{index=204}. It moved erratically: darting left-right, up-down in rapid, jerky motions that defied known aerodynamics:contentReference[oaicite:205]{index=205}:contentReference[oaicite:206]{index=206}. Fravor began a circular descent to get closer, at which point the Tic Tac object rapidly ascended to mirror his plane’s altitude. Then, in an instantaneous burst of acceleration, it zoomed past the F/A-18 and vanished in the distance in a matter of a second or two:contentReference[oaicite:207]{index=207}:contentReference[oaicite:208]{index=208}. Radar operators on Princeton reported that in under a minute the UFO reappeared 60 miles away at the pilots’ CAP station – essentially anticipating where the jets would next go:contentReference[oaicite:209]{index=209}. A second wave of fighters launched; one pilot (Lt. Chad Underwood) managed to lock the object on his FLIR targeting camera, capturing a short infrared video showing an oval shape with no heat signature, darting away at high speed. The incident, kept quiet until it leaked in 2017, has since been confirmed by the Navy as an \"Unidentified Aerial Phenomena\" encounter. It is frequently cited as evidence of beyond-next-generation technology due to the craft’s instantaneous acceleration, hypersonic velocity, and the inability of even top-gun pilots to match its maneuvers.:contentReference[oaicite:210]{index=210}:contentReference[oaicite:211]{index=211}",
